/**
 * This assignment will write a method to determine how many occurrences of a string appear in another string.
 * 1. Create a new Java Class named Part2 in the StringsSecondAssignments project.
 *
 * 2. Write the method named howMany that has two String parameters named stringa and stringb.
 * - This method returns an integer indicating how many times stringa appears in stringb, where each occurrence of stringa must not overlap with another occurrence of it. 
 * - For example, the call howMany(“GAA”, “ATGAACGAATTGAATC”) returns 3 as GAA occurs 3 times.
 * - The call howMany(“AA”, “ATAAAA”) returns 2. Note that the AA’s found cannot overlap.
 *
 * 3.Write the void method testHowMany has no parameters. 
 * - Add code in here to call howMany with several examples and print the results. 
 * - Think carefully about what types of examples would be good to test to make sure your method works correctly.
